# MRI Brain Scan Classifier

This deep learning project classifies MRI brain scan images into four categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It achieves up to **99.3% accuracy** on a public Kaggle dataset, demonstrating strong performance on medical imaging tasks.

## 🧠 Classification Categories

- Glioma Tumor
- Meningioma Tumor
- Pituitary Tumor
- No Tumor

## 🧪 Results

- Run 1: **99.3% Accuracy**
- Run 2: **98.4% Accuracy**
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `notebooks/model_run_99_3.ipynb`: Training notebook with highest accuracy
- `notebooks/model_run_98_4.ipynb`: Alternate training run with slight variation

## 📈 Highlights

- Built and trained multiple CNN architectures
- Applied image normalization, resizing, and augmentation
- Evaluated using multiple metrics beyond accuracy
- Cleaned and preprocessed public Kaggle data

## 🚀 How to Run

1. it was ran on kaggle
